// Event union for the platform's control plane.
//
// The bus is the medium through which the sequencer, MIDI input, UI
// knobs, automation lanes, and recorders all talk. Producers emit;
// consumers subscribe. Zero Web Audio dependency — synchronous,
// mockable, testable.
//
// Address conventions (target / channel.* paths):
//   channel.0                          → trigger the voice on channel 0
//   channel.0.color.cutoff             → param on channel 0's color FX
//   channel.0.level                    → param on channel 0's level gain
//   master.reverb.size                 → param on the master reverb bus
//   bar / step / clock                 → time markers, no target
//
// Address strings are NOT validated at the type level — the router
// looks them up at dispatch time. This is intentional: addresses are
// data (savable, MIDI-mappable) and should stay open-ended.
