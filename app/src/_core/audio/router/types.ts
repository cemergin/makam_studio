// Router — address-based dispatch from the EventBus into the audio
// graph. Producers emit ParamEvents with target like
// `channel.0.color.cutoff`; the router walks the address, finds the
// registered ControllableModule, and calls its .set() with the value.
//
// The router doesn't care WHERE events come from. UI knobs, MIDI CCs,
// automation lanes, and saved-state hydration all dispatch through
// the same router via the bus.

/** A bus address — a dotted path the router resolves into a module +
 *  param. Template-literal type so a typo like `master.gain.gain` is
 *  a compile error at the producer rather than a silent dead mapping
 *  at the consumer. Bus events themselves still carry plain strings
 *  (incoming MIDI / persisted automation / external sources) — the
 *  branded form is for code we control.
 *
 *  Examples:
 *    `channel.0`              — channel mixer (level/pan/sends)
 *    `channel.0.color`        — color FX module
 *    `channel.0.machine`      — voice machine
 *    `master.gain`            — output gain bus
 *    `master.reverb`          — reverb FX module
 *
 *  Use the helper constructors below in producer code; raw strings
 *  are still valid in event payloads (`.target: string`). */
